after exploring data analysis (EDA folder), let create a new folder to do: Investigate Section 150 in detail - the highest-risk 
section with 301 disturbance events:

1. EVENT BREAKDOWN:
   - Complete timeline of all 301 events with causes
   - Temporal clustering analysis (are events bunched or random?)
   - Cause distribution specific to this section
   - Compare to network average

2. SECTION CHARACTERISTICS:
   - Extract all PMU details for Section 150 from PMUs sheet
   - Compare voltage, type, age, location to sections with similar profiles
   - Identify what makes Section 150 unique

3. ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS:
   - Statistical tests: Is Section 150's failure rate significantly higher?
   - What are the top 5 causes for this section specifically?
   - Time-to-failure analysis between consecutive events
   - Seasonal/cyclical patterns specific to Section 150

4. COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS:
   - Find the 10 most similar sections (by voltage, location, type)
   - Why do they have fewer events?
   - What can Section 150 learn from them?

5. RECOMMENDATIONS:
   - Specific, actionable maintenance interventions
   - Expected risk reduction
   - Cost-benefit if possible
   - Monitoring frequency recommendations

Create 5-7 visualizations focused on Section 150 and deliver a 2-page executive summary.
