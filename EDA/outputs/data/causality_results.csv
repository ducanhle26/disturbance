He said that the under-build line goes to an abandoned house. He recommends that transmission engineering investigate raising our 138kV line. He also noticed that while driving out this line section, all of the spans sag at about the same amount. On the line from Woodward District to Wind Farm SS, at the time of the trip and re-closings, there was about 140MW–145MW, the temp was about 40 Deg. F. and there was little to no wind at their location of the under-build.

They further explained that the issues originated in the Princeville sub and was on the DCC side.   At 09:15 1/5/19 Bluebell 6 was closed by scada.
